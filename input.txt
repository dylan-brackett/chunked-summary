Tennessee is a landlocked state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It is the 36th largest state and the 15th most populous. Tennessee is divided into three regions: East, Middle, and West Tennessee. Nashville is the capital and largest city. Other major cities include Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Clarksville. The state's population is approximately 6.9 million. Tennessee's history dates back to the Watauga Association and its name comes from the Cherokee town of Tanasi. It became the 16th state in 1796 and earned the nickname "The Volunteer State" due to its military tradition. During the Civil War, Tennessee was politically divided. Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian society to a diversified economy in the 20th century with the help of federal investments like the Tennessee Valley Authority.

Oak Ridge, Tennessee was established during World War II to house the Manhattan Project's uranium enrichment facilities. After the war, Oak Ridge National Laboratory became a key center of scientific research. Tennessee has also played a major role in the development of popular music genres such as country, blues, rock and roll, soul, and gospel. The state has diverse terrain and cultural features, including the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Cumberland Plateau, and the Mississippi River. Its economy is dominated by sectors such as healthcare, music, finance, automotive, and tourism, and agriculture is an important industry. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the nation's most visited national park.

Tennessee gets its name from the Cherokee town of Tanasi, located in Monroe County, Tennessee. The name comes from the Yuchi word Tana-tsee-dgee, meaning "brother-waters-place" or "where-the-waters-meet." The spelling "Tennessee" was adopted by Governor James Glen of South Carolina. The state was established in 1796. It has a total area of 42,143 square miles and a population of 7,051,339 as of 2022. The official language is English, with a majority of the population speaking English at home. Tennessee is located in the Eastern Time Zone.

Tennessee was adopted as the state's name. The first inhabitants of Tennessee were Paleo-Indians who arrived about 12,000 years ago. The area was rich with game animals. The Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian periods saw the development of different cultures and the domestication of animals and plants. Spanish explorers encountered the Mississippian peoples, and by the 18th century, most Natives had disappeared, likely due to diseases introduced by the Spaniards. The Cherokee began migrating to eastern Tennessee to escape European settlement.

In the early 18th century, the Shawnee were forced out of the state, while the Chickasaw remained in West Tennessee. The middle part of the state had few Native Americans, but both the Cherokee and the Shawnee claimed the region. The Cherokee in Tennessee were known as the Overhill Cherokee. The first recorded European expeditions into Tennessee were led by Spanish and French explorers. In 1673, a French expedition explored the Mississippi River and mapped the Mississippi Valley. In 1682, a French fort was constructed on the Chickasaw Bluffs. French traders also began to explore the Cumberland River valley.

In the 1700s, the French constructed Fort Assumption in Memphis to use as a base against the Chickasaw. Settlers from South Carolina built Fort Loudoun, the first British settlement in Tennessee. Conflict erupted between the British and the Cherokees, leading to a siege of the fort. After the French and Indian War, Britain issued a proclamation forbidding settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains, but migration continued. European settlers began arriving in northeastern Tennessee in the late 1760s, forming the Watauga Association and later the Washington District to support the American Revolutionary War.

In the late 18th century, settlers in Tennessee faced Native American attacks. Richard Henderson negotiated treaties with the Cherokee to sell land, and Daniel Boone blazed a trail through the Cumberland Gap. The Chickamauga Cherokee, led by Dragging Canoe, opposed the settlement and attacked Fort Watauga. Settlers led by James Robertson and John Donelson established Fort Nashborough, which later became Nashville. John Sevier and the Overmountain Men defeated the British at the Battle of Kings Mountain. The Washington District formed the State of Franklin, but eventually rejoined North Carolina. The area became the Southwest Territory in 1790.

The Southwest Territory, which would later become the state of Tennessee, was established in 1790. It was divided into two districts and governed by William Blount. By 1795, the population had reached 77,263, and a poll showed 6,504 in favor of statehood. A constitutional convention was held in 1796, where the name Tennessee was chosen for the new state. The state constitution was completed on February 6, and on June 1, 1796, Tennessee became the 16th state of the Union. Tennessee earned the nickname "The Volunteer State" during the War of 1812.

Tennessee played a significant role in various wars, including the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 and the Texas Revolution. The state's nickname, "The Volunteer State," was earned during the Mexican-American War. Land negotiations with Native American tribes led to additional cessions and the forced removal of Cherokees in the Trail of Tears. The expansion westward led to a slavery-based agrarian economy, with cotton plantations relying on slave labor. Entrepreneurs like Montgomery Bell used slaves in iron production.

The geography of East Tennessee did not allow for large plantations, so slavery was rare in the region. There was a strong abolition movement in East Tennessee, with the nation's first antislavery newspaper being published there. During the Civil War, most Middle and West Tennesseans favored preserving slavery, while most East Tennesseans favored remaining in the Union. Tennessee provided more Union troops than any other Confederate state and saw more military engagements than any state except Virginia. After initially rejecting secession, Tennessee eventually joined the Confederacy.

In the fall of 1861, Unionists in East Tennessee burned bridges and attacked Confederate sympathizers, leading to martial law being imposed. Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as military governor of the state. The Union captured the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers and Memphis in 1862. Confederate offensives in Middle Tennessee were repelled, culminating in the Battle of Stones River. The Union then forced Confederate troops in Middle Tennessee to retreat to Chattanooga. The Confederates attempted to besiege the Union army but were driven out at the battles of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge. Despite Unionist sentiment, the Confederates held East Tennessee for most of the war.

The Atlanta campaign was a significant battle in May 1864. The Army of Tennessee invaded Middle Tennessee later that year but were ultimately defeated by Union forces. The Sultana steamboat explosion in April 1865 was the worst maritime disaster in American history, resulting in the deaths of 1,168 people. Tennessee was largely held by Union forces during the Emancipation Proclamation, so it did not free any slaves until Andrew Johnson declared them free in October 1864. Tennessee was the only Southern state to abolish slavery through a state constitution amendment. Tennessee ratified the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. Reconstruction in Tennessee saw tensions between blacks and former Confederates, particularly in Memphis in 1866. The state did not have a military governor during Reconstruction due to its earlier ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.

During the Reconstruction period in Tennessee after the Civil War, African American men were allowed to vote and action was taken against the Ku Klux Klan. However, Southern Democrats regained control of the state legislature and implemented Jim Crow laws for racial segregation. Tennessee saw epidemics of cholera and yellow fever, while cities like Chattanooga and Memphis became industrialized. The state also turned to convict leasing to pay off debts, leading to protests. Agriculture continued to dominate Tennessee's economy, with freed slaves being forced into sharecropping.

In the 19th century, many people in Tennessee worked as agricultural wage laborers. In 1897, the state celebrated its centennial late with the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition in Nashville, where a replica of the Parthenon was constructed. In the early 20th century, due to segregation and poor living conditions, many black Tennesseans migrated to industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest as part of the Great Migration. Tennessee also became the first state to effectively ban alcohol during the Temperance movement. Sgt. Alvin C. York, a resident of Fentress County, became a famous World War I veteran. Tennessee suffered the worst rail accident in U.S. history in 1918. In 1920, Tennessee became the final state to ratify the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote.

In summary, the Butler Act was passed recently. The famous Scopes trial highlighted the controversy between creationism and evolution. In 1926, a national park was established in the Great Smoky Mountains. During the Great Depression, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created to bring electricity, jobs, and economic development to the state. The TVA built hydroelectric dams that displaced communities. During World War II, Oak Ridge was built for the production of atomic bombs as part of the Manhattan Project.

During the mid-20th century, three major facilities for atomic bombs were established, with the first test detonation taking place in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Oak Ridge National Laboratory became a center for scientific research after the war. In 1955, Oak Ridge High School became the first integrated school in Tennessee, followed by the integration of Clinton High School. Sit-ins in Nashville in 1960 led to the desegregation of facilities. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 occurred in Memphis, where he was supporting striking sanitation workers. The 1962 Baker v. Carr case established the principle of "one man, one vote". The construction of Interstate 40 in Memphis led to a landmark case on eminent domain.

Tennessee has had several significant events in its history. In the 1970s, the construction of the Tellico Dam caused controversy due to its impact on the endangered snail darter fish. The Supreme Court case Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill in 1978 led to changes in the Endangered Species Act. The 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville focused on energy. Tennessee celebrated its bicentennial in 1996 and established a state park called Bicentennial Mall. The Ocoee River hosted the whitewater slalom events of the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 2002, Tennessee established a lottery, and in 2006, same-sex marriage was outlawed, although this was later invalidated. The state also experienced a major industrial waste spill in 2008 at the TVA's Kingston Fossil Plant.
