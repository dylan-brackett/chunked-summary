This paper discusses the development and application of an Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithm for aircraft fault detection. The algorithm is designed to detect a wide range of known and unforeseen failures by using sensory data to generate pattern detectors. The algorithm is tested using data sets collected under normal and simulated failure conditions. The results show that the immunity-based fault detection algorithm improves the fault tolerance capabilities of the Intelligent Flight Controller (IFC) architecture.

This paper presents an immunity-based approach to fault detection in aircraft flight. The approach utilizes a probabilistic algorithm inspired by the negative selection mechanism of the immune system. The algorithm detects deviations in flight behavior patterns and can identify a broad spectrum of known and unforeseen faults. Once a fault is detected, a direct adaptive control system can stabilize the aircraft using available resources. The algorithm is based on self-non-self discrimination and generates a set of pattern detectors to detect abnormalities in flight behavior. The algorithm is applied to intelligent flight control for fault detection and isolation. It uses a real-valued Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) and evolves a set of variable-size detectors to cover the non-self space. The algorithm is iterative and adjusts the centers of the detectors to reduce overlap and maximize coverage of the non-self space. Detectors with large radii are selected for the next generation, while detectors with small radii are discarded and replaced with clones of better-fit detectors.

Researchers at NASA Ames have developed an Intelligent Flight Control (IFC) system that can compensate for a variety of failures in flight and propulsion control. The system uses an optimal allocation technique to allocate control power to remaining sources after damage or failure. The IFC architecture was evaluated using a flight simulator and was found to be effective. An extension to the IFC system using an immunity-based fault detection system is proposed, which would minimize the control "dead band" induced by failed surfaces. The MILD (Multi-level Immune Learning Detection) software was developed based on the real-valued negative selection algorithm to implement the fault detection system.

The text describes a fault detection system that consists of two phases: detector generation and fault detection. The detector generation phase implements a real-valued negative selection algorithm to generate detectors based on input parameters such as training data, window size, overlapping value, etc. The fault detection phase uses the mature detectors generated in the previous phase to detect anomalies in testing data. The system aims to find specialized detectors for known failure conditions and generalized detectors for unknown conditions. The system was tested using aircraft simulated data and the scenarios were designed to test the performance of the controllers.

The text discusses a study on fault detection in aircraft. The study includes scenarios of full tail failure, wing failure, and engine failure. Data was collected and analyzed using neural networks and detectors. The effectiveness of the detectors in identifying faults was examined. The results show that the detection system was able to detect abnormal patterns and activate detectors when faults occurred.

The study investigates an immunity-based approach for fault detection in aircraft. The proposed algorithm uses principles from the biological immune system to detect a broad range of known and unknown failures. The algorithm generates a set of fault detectors based on patterns learned from normal flight data. The detectors can identify abnormalities and faults in aircraft behavior. The goal is to use this detection information to stabilize the aircraft and achieve desired flight performance. The algorithm has shown low false alarm rates and the ability to detect various types of faults.

The use of overlapping detectors and generalized detectors can help in detecting and identifying faults and abnormalities in aircraft. The goal is to achieve damage control and ensure safe flight conditions. Adaptive control strategies and neural networks can be utilized for flight control and fault detection. The use of intelligent flight controllers can help in achieving desired flight performance even in the presence of failures or damage.
